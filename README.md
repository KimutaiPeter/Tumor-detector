# Automated Brain Tumor Diagnostics Model Using Computer Vision

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a computer vision model designed to assist in the detection of cancerous cells from medical images. The project utilizes deep learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient diagnostic support, complete with an intuitive user interface for deployment.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on medical images for cancer detection.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques to enhance model generalization across diverse datasets.
- **Interpretability:** Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for visual explanations of the modelâ€™s predictions.
- **User Interface:** A web-based application for easy deployment and interaction with the model.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- `pip` package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-cancer-diagnostics.git
cd automated-cancer-diagnostics
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download Model and Weights

1. Download the pre-trained model and weights from the provided link (e.g., Google Drive or other cloud storage).
2. Place the downloaded files in the `model` directory.

## Usage

### Running the Web Application

1. Ensure you are in the project's root directory.
2. Start the web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.

### Uploading Images

- Use the web interface to upload medical images for diagnosis.
- The application will display diagnostic results along with visual explanations.

### Model Inference (Command Line)

You can also run model inference directly from the command line:

```bash
python infer.py --image-path path/to/image
```

## Model Training

### Training Script

To train the model, use the `train.py` script. Customize the script as needed to fit your dataset and requirements:

```bash
python train.py --data-dir path/to/dataset --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
```

### Configuration

Edit the `config.py` file to adjust training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and model architecture.

## Evaluation

### Evaluate the Model

To evaluate the trained model on a test dataset, use the `evaluate.py` script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --data-dir path/to/test-dataset
```

### Metrics

The evaluation script provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).
